Changelog
=========

0.3.1 (2010-01-21)
------------------

* Bug fix: the success message of a Delete form is a property and
  can't be called directly through the class. We need to use fget.


0.3 (2009-12-26)
----------------

* The layout now provides and uses a way to include resources, using
  megrok.resourceviewlet. Two components have been added for that:
  ResourcesManager and Resource, respectively a viewletmanager and a
  viewlet base class.

* The imports has been modified to avoid using any zope.app package.
